## What is Plain Text Encryption?
Plain Text Encryption is a simple website that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using the AES cryptographic algorithm.

### Platforms
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

### Dependencies
None.

## Motivation
Another user requested me help to encrypt/decrypt his passwords securely, so I made a simple website that allowed him to do it himself.

## Installation and usage
Open `index.html` and you're ready to go.
